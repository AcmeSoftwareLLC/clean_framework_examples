# Clean Framework Firebase Example

A sample social media-styled app, showcasing how one can use `clean_framework_firestore` alongside `clean_framework` to read and write data to a Firebase Firestore database.

## Getting Started

Firstly, make sure you have a Firebase project created, have enabled the 'Firestore Database' feature, and have installed the Firebase CLI and FlutterFire CLI. If you haven't yet set up the CLI's, follow [this](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios) guide.

Once your Firebase project is set up, run this command in the root directory of this project:

```
flutterfire configure
```

After running this command, select your project and the platforms you want to support from within the command line, and then the project should be ready to run.

From there, create a post from within the app, and you will see it on the homepage!
